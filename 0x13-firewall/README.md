# Firewall Configuration
In networking configurations, firewalls act as essential security barriers that protect computer networks from unauthorized access and potential threats. Acting like a virtual gatekeeper, firewalls monitor incoming and outgoing traffic, inspecting data packets and applying predefined rules to determine whether to allow or block them. By enforcing security policies, firewalls prevent malicious attempts to breach the network, such as hackers, viruses, and unauthorized access, while allowing legitimate communication to flow seamlessly. This critical layer of defense ensures the integrity and confidentiality of network resources, safeguarding sensitive data and providing a secure environment for users and connected devices.
