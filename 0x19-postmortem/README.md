# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary

**Duration**: August 5th, 2023, 15:30 - 18:45 (UTC)
**Impact**: The user authentication service experienced intermittent slowdowns, affecting 20% of users. Users reported delays in login and access to their accounts.

## Timeline

- **15:30**: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased response times.
- **15:35**: Initial investigation started by the DevOps team. Assumed high load due to recent feature release.
- **15:50**: Load balancers and application servers inspected for potential bottlenecks.
- **16:15**: Misleading lead: Database performance investigated extensively despite limited indicators.
- **16:45**: Escalated to backend development team due to prolonged investigation.
- **17:30**: Engineering realized incorrect indexes on the user table leading to slow queries.
- **18:00**: Corrective action: Indexes were added to the database and services monitored for improvement.
- **18:45**: Services recovered, response times normalized.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause**: Slow queries were caused by missing indexes on the user table, leading to increased database load and degraded service performance.

**Resolution**: Indexes were added to the database based on query analysis. The introduction of indexes optimized data retrieval and improved database query execution times.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes**:
- Implement regular database performance audits to identify optimization opportunities.
- Strengthen the deployment process to include database indexing verification before releasing new features.

**Tasks**:
1. **Patch Nginx Server**: Update Nginx configuration to handle potential spikes in traffic more efficiently.
2. **Implement Comprehensive Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for database query performance to detect slow queries in real-time.
3. **Database Index Review**: Conduct a thorough review of database indexes across critical tables to ensure optimal query performance.

## Learnings and Conclusion

The recent web stack outage was caused by an unforeseen database performance bottleneck resulting from missing indexes. While humorous memes and cat GIFs won't fix database issues, they do remind us that even tech heroes can occasionally encounter challenges. Swift detection and teamwork led to a speedy resolution. We acknowledge that troubleshooting can sometimes lead us down misleading paths, but perseverance and collaboration ultimately led us to the root cause.

As we navigate the digital realm, we're reminded that even the tiniest database index can wield tremendous power over our applications. Our commitment to continuous improvement is underscored by the adoption of proactive monitoring, regular audits, and ensuring robust deployment practices.

In conclusion, let's toast to databases, indexes, and the resilience of our engineering team. As we move forward, we do so with a renewed sense of vigilance, armed with better tools and strategies to ward off any unexpected gremlins lurking in our code.

Remember, while our databases might be silent, our commitment to reliability speaks volumes!

*Stay glitch-free, my friends.*
